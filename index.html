                <p><b>What does it mean to be XYZ?</b><br>
                <br>Nancy Lublin, CEO of DoSomething.org, was asked to write a book about how DoSomething.org has created such a great culture.<br>
                <br>Her response? “Not alone. I’d be a douche if I did this without my team." And, that is where this book began.<br>
                <br>The XYZ Factor is a new kind of organizational culture where innovation, accessibility, and transparency are the norm. An XYZ organization's employees are challenged, engaged and excited to produce.<br>
                <br>Any company can become an XYZ company. This book is your blueprint.<br>
                <br>This guidebook is your key to  answering the questions your company has looming over its cubicles: How do I motivate my staff? How do I form the right partnerships? Where’s the right place to start with data collection? …  just to name a few.  The answers to these questions and more are sprawled across nine chapters written by various staff members of the DoSomething.org team.<br>
                <br>When you open The XYZ Factor, you’re getting the recipe for the awesome-sauce that has driven the success of one of the world’s largest organizations for young people and social change.</p>
